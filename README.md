# final-project

## A dynamic, full stack JavaScript solo project.

This project provides a simple, functional platform for businesses to utilize a digital queue system.

As society continues to yearn for togetherness, small-businesses often struggle to keep up with the demand and onset of customer clientele.  This application affords businesses a simple yet practical platform to keep track of guests and patrons.  Whether operating food services such as dining establishments, providing personal care via salons and barbershops, or simply having the need for a digital waitlist, WaitingFuze allows users to keep track of a waiting log.

As the world continues to race around us, waiting shouldn't feel like forever.
